A computational framework for reducing complexity in machine translation using attention models and Pyramidal Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture.


Neural machine translation (NMT) is a technique for machine translation that leverages an artificial neural network to estimate the probability of a sequence of words, typically by modeling complete sentences in a unified, integrated model.
